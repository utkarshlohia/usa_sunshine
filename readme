The visualization presents a decade-long perspective on sunshine minutes across 
the United States from 2010 to 2020. It utilizes a map with markers whose sizes 
dynamically represent the minutes of sunshine observed in various locations. 
This approach was chosen for intuitiveness of size comparison and the simplicity
yet comprehensive complation of maps.

To facilitate easy comparison, a slider for months was included, enabling users 
to visualize averge minutes of sunshine month-by-month. Additionally, a dropdown
menu allows users to select the specific year they wish to explore, ensuring a 
focused examination of data without overwhelming the viewer.The choice of a solid 
grey map background avoids emphasizing specific cities or states, allowing the 
sun markers to bring the attention to areas on the map. The font colors are shades 
of grey with blue undertones to complement the dark blue background of the map 
container. This background color provides contrast between the markers outside 
flowing of map edges and the background, and aiding viewers in understanding 
regional variations by conserving state limits.The size of the markers ranges from 
a minimum radius of 2 to the observed maximum minutes of sunshine, divided by 50. 
This scaling maintains proportional differences while preventing markers from 
becoming disproportionately large and overwhelming the visualization. 
Tooltips provide additional information, displaying the minutes of sunshine 
when hovering over a marker.

Originally, a calendar interface allowed users to select any date from 2010-01-01 
to 2020-12-31. However, this was awkward for analysis. Users would have to select 
each day on the dropdown calendar to make comparisons. By summarizing 
the data to months and employing a slider alongside date text, users can swiftly 
compare sunshine minutes on a broader scale. Adjustments were made to optimize 
user experience, including moving the date text below the slider to prevent 
shifting object positions during interaction.

In this collaborative project, our team worked synchronously, alternating between 
joint coding sessions and individual tasks. Whether gathered in person or connected 
via Zoom, our workflow involved continuous communication and shared decision-making.
On a high level, Rishaant Jain took charge of data cleaning and preparation, 
ensuring that the dataset was formatted appropriately for visualization. 
Utkarsh Lohia focused on implementing the marker functionality, fine-tuning 
their appearance and behavior on the map. Laura Diaz Rodriguez spearheaded the 
base visualization and design, establishing the overall aesthetic and layout.

Despite our focus, collaboration was central to our process. We provided feedback 
and guidance to each other, ensuring that all aspects of the project met our 
collective standards. Debugging and refining each component became a team effort, 
with everyone contributing. One particularly challenging aspect was the 
implementation of the markers, which required careful attention to detail. 
In total, we dedicated approximately 10 hours to this project.
